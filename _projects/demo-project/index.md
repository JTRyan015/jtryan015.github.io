title: Aeronautical Propulsion Project
description:  The purpose of this project was to design a turbojet engine with the capabilities of producing 75lb of thrust. The engine was designed for sea-level operations on a lab table. The outlet speed of the engine was required to be Mach 1.5, and the fuel used was methane. The project required detailed calculations for the inlet flow conditions, with respect to the geometry of the diffuser. The flow conditions were then applied to a 2-stage compressor, and the flow conditions were then found for all substages of the compressor. The same process was done for the turbine as well. The combustion section was done in ANSYS Fluent CFD. The outlet conditions of the combustor were found by using the surface integral in ANSYS, which enables the turbine calculations. Finally, the outlet was designed as a converging-diverging nozzle, the flow conditions were analytically calculated, and then confirmed in ANSYS fluent as well.
