title: Bench Press Safety Mechanism Design Project
description: Designed a bench press with a counterweight and lifting arms that would be activated when the user pressed a foot pedal. The Project included stress analysis for all the components, connections, and the power train. The analysis was done ensuring a factor of safety above two for all parts, with respect to yielding, buckling, and fatigue. Finally, the design was analyzed for potential final cost of the product based on materials and manufacturing costs.
